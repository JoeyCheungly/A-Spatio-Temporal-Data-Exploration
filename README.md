## Introduction

With the increasing availability of location-based services and social media platforms, large volumes of check-in data are being generated, providing valuable insights into human mobility patterns and urban dynamics. In this project, we focus on indexing and querying check-in data in New York City to facilitate spatial-temporal analysis and exploration.

## Features

- Six indexing algorithms for high-dimensional data namely Quad tree, K- d tree and R-tree, Geo-hash, Grid-based, Linear scan were introduced. 
- Query tasks ranging from range query, distance query to nearest neighbour query etc. based on the check-in data points in New York City were designed and efficiently solved with the algorithms.
- Example code for performing spatial-temporal analysis and visualization of check-in data.
- Integration with popular GIS tools and libraries for geospatial analysis.
- SQL was used to construct database in PostgreSQL and validate the implementation.

## Usage

To get started with indexing and querying check-ins in New York City, follow these steps:

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Read the report at 'Report.pdf' for detailed analysis. 
3. Explore the code examples provided in the `src` folder. Experiment with indexing check-in data, performing queries, and visualizing the results.

## Dataset

The dataset used in the experiment is the user activity of citizens in the New York City (NYC) during 2012 and 2013, provided in `dataset_TSMC2014_NYC.csv`. The data are the check-ins collected from FourSquare. Each check-in is associated with the information of the user, venue, venueâ€™s category, GPS coordinates and time stamp
